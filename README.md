DTS Developer Technical Test - Junior Software Developer

For this challange i started off by desinging a UML diagram so i could reference the console project.
The main project started off from console as a test harness and the back end of the modules being in a modules folder.

Once the project was running up to standard I migrated the modules to a class library .logic.
I also created a front end API for the sql database to be interacted with.

The project has the old console and new api. unit tests are included in the solution.

I have added a HTML webpage for the project to be interfaced with. It was mostly generated with AI and i only changed a few things.
